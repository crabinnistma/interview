Ip Man 4: The Finale is the fourth and final film in the Ip Man series, which started in 2008 and starred Donnie Yen as the titular character. The series is loosely based on the life of Ip Man, who was a grandmaster of Wing Chun and one of the most influential martial artists of the 20th century. He is best known for being the mentor of Bruce Lee, who also appears in the film series as a young and rebellious student.
 
The film is directed by Wilson Yip, who also helmed the previous three films, and features action choreography by Yuen Woo-ping, who is famous for his work on The Matrix, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and Kill Bill. The film also stars Scott Adkins, Danny Chan, Vanness Wu, Chris Collins, and Wu Yue. The film was released in December 2019 in China and Hong Kong, and in January 2020 in the United States and other countries. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, and became the highest-grossing film in the series.
 
Ip Man 4: The Finale is a fitting conclusion to the saga of Ip Man, who is portrayed as a humble and honorable hero who fights for justice and peace. The film showcases his skills and philosophy of Wing Chun, as well as his relationship with his family and students. The film also explores the themes of racism, discrimination, and cultural clash in the 1960s America, where Chinese immigrants faced hostility and prejudice from some locals. The film delivers spectacular fight scenes that are both realistic and artistic, as well as emotional moments that touch the heart. Ip Man 4: The Finale is a must-watch for fans of martial arts films and Ip Man's legacy.
